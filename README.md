# Forkify JS Project

This is by far the most complex Recipe Application, in which users can find cool recipes, bookmark them, check all the ingredients
and increase the servings. Also they can go the recipe publisher's page and learn more about that recipe. And if that is not enough,
users can add their own recipes and have them saved for later, with all the ingredients and the servings.
I hope you'll have fun using my cool Recipe App - Forkify!
